# Hello, I'm Apostla/Mxsail/IaMaAVerYRANdOmPerSoN!
Now that I know the page is working, I should probably talk about my goals for my new personal web page. I've been informed that a personal web page demonstrates real-world skills and is a much more accessible format for explaining oneself than boring essays, providing significant leverage towards post-secondary applications.

That aside, I'm sure creating and maintaining a personal web page will be a fun experience, and I'll certainly pick up some valuable [Problem-Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/1197034) skills! I'll start by using the `minimal` Jekyll theme, gradually overwriting the default HTML/CSS until my website is completely my own!

This first post marks the beginning of a very long journey ahead. I've got a lot of work before me before this site becomes anywhere near impressive, and I am certainly still learning. I may eventually write my own custom backend and move away from GitHub Pages, though I shouldn't get too exited... I'm rather prone to overengineering systems that turn into complete slops, pursuing something on too tight a schedule for me to fully accommodate it.

We have a great adventure ahead of us! I hope this is something I will look back upon with pride!
